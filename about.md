Hello.

I'm Heiswayi Nrird, or just call me "Wayi" for short. A Software Engineer at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com), Penang, Malaysia. I experiment, code and build some stuffs. Sometimes, I love to [click with my camera](https://heiswayi.github.io/my-photography/) and explore the beauty of nature (hiking). Some of my works[^1] have shared/published on [GitHub](http://github.com/heiswayi), [Gist](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-gists/), [CodePen](http://codepen.io/heiswayi/) and [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/user/heiswayi/). For professional experience, check out [my online resume here ⤯•••](https://heiswayi.github.io/resume/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/nrird). I can be contacted at [hnrird@gmail.com](mailto:hnrird@gmail.com).

I also run [nrird·xyz](http://nrird.xyz), a personal project called creative studio that focuses on UX design, front-end app development and data visualization.
