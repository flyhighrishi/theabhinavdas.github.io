Hi.

I am **Heiswayi Nrird**, a.k.a. "WAYI" for short. A _Software Engineer_ at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com), Penang, Malaysia. I experiment, code and build some geeky stuffs. Sometimes, I love to [click with my camera](https://heiswayi.github.io/my-photography/) and explore the beauty of nature. Some of my works[^1] can be found on these following sites; [GitHub](http://github.com/heiswayi), [Gist](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-gists/), [CodePen](http://codepen.io/heiswayi/) and [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/user/heiswayi/). For professional details, check out [my online resume](https://heiswayi.github.io/resume/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://my.linkedin.com/in/nrird), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/heiswayi.nrird) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/heiswayi.nrird/). If you have any inquiry, feel free to get in touch at [hnrird@gmail.com](mailto:hnrird@gmail.com).

I also run [nrirdÂ·xyz](http://nrird.xyz), a personal project called creative studio that focuses on UX design, front-end app development and data visualization.
