Namaskaar!

I'm Abhinav Das. I go by various aliases including "Abhi," supay, phantomcoder and 0x23212f. I am a innovation specialist with deep software engineering and architecture background. I currently serve as the Head of Innovation at [Hexon Global LLC](https://hexonglobal.com) and also as a Director at [Teqsense](https://teqsense.com) - my venture builder business. I experiment, code, dream, build and break stuff. Things that interest me the most today are blockchain, AI/ML, RPA, computer vision, cybersecurity and IoT. I'm also interested in the convergence of two or more of these technologies. You may connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/theabhinavdas) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theabhinavdas). My email id is - x at abhinav das dot com. 

Interestingly, the technology field might not be my true passion. I love making people laugh - there's something special about that. I do stand-up comedy in my spare time. I also play the violin in the hindustani classical style of the Maihar gharana.
